Find the same picture on 2 different cards. Only 1 picture matches.
The person that recignizes first wins. You may practice trying to get highest score, play against another human on the same machine or play against computer, that will 
find a matching pare in a random time. 

This game is in order to try to find a good and clean way of writing things in pure JS. 
Writhing things in pure JS was always a bit of a chalange. When using a custom web element, there is a problem with passing 
information between objects in a clear and clean way. When writing without custom web element API things get even more out of hand.
That is why a clear way of creating components always in the same way, and establishing communication between those elemets in the same way 
is important.

When project is ready I will describe more.
